This the first homework part according to that link:
https://github.com/oleg-shumar/php-academy.kiev.ua/blob/master/php_basics_tasks/index.html

>>If you are too lazy to open every file you can proceed to open just one 'All-in-one tasks.php' and with a help of your local-server run that homework.
In that file you will find each task starting from '//task N', where N - is the number of task.
The task-target (what should be and what is asked) you can find in the link above.
I do not think that it would be difficult for you to understand and to open just two tabs.

>>If you are some kind of man-of-rules, you should open every file, run your local-server and run the file afterwards.
In every file you will find the task, number of t and the task-target.
The original link of all tasks is mentioned above.

Thank you!
